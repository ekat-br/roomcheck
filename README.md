Created a school app for Leibniz Montessori Gymnasium, allowing 500+ students to effortlessly choose study rooms during their daily learning slots. RoomCheck provides quick room availability overview, freeing students from room search. Teachers manage room statuses seamlessly. A small app with a big benefit!
